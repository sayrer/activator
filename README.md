activator
=========

An experiment with [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) and event activation with purely virtual event targets.

Event handling code comes from the [Closure Library](https://github.com/google/closure-library/), but ported to TypeScript. Most of the code in the project comes directly from there.

To generate the JavaScript for the basic event handler example in index.html,

    npm install
    npm run compile
